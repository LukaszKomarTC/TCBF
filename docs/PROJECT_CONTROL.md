📘 TC Booking Flow — Project Control Document

Single Source of Truth (SSOT)
This document defines the architecture, execution history, and actionable backlog for the TC Booking Flow project.

📌 Purpose

This document serves two distinct purposes:

Document the main execution roadmap (historical, frozen)

Collect and manage all issues, ideas, and improvements discovered during development (actionable)

🧭 How This Document Is Used

Section A — Main Execution Roadmap

Historical

Mostly frozen

Explains what, why, and in what order

Not an issue tracker

Section B — Issues & Ideas Backlog

Actionable

Non-sequential

Each item handled in a separate chat / GitHub issue

Evolves over time

Chat threads are short-lived

This document preserves project knowledge

Legacy threads (e.g. TC Booking Flow Analysis, Booking Flow Issues) are historical only

SECTION A — MAIN EXECUTION ROADMAP (HISTORICAL)

⚠️ This section is read-only.
It documents how the system was built and is not worked through again.

TC Booking Flow — Main Work List
1. Freeze baseline + rules of the system

Baseline version frozen (initial working state)

Rule locked:
Events decide → Forms collect → PHP calculates once → Woo enforces

Status: ✅ Done

2. Parity with legacy flow (GF → Cart → Order)

GF44 population works on sc_event pages

Driver fields populate

Conditional logic triggers correctly

Add-to-cart works deterministically

Snapshot pricing stored on cart & order items
Status: ✅ Done

3. Rental UI lifecycle hardening (GF image choices toggle bug)

Fix image choices disabling after rental toggle

Implement gform_post_render + re-enable logic in plugin

Remove last fragile JS dependency
Status: ✅ Done

4. Booking scopes separation (participation + rental)

Participation booking (no resources)

Rental booking (with resources)

Linked via order + metadata

Email / booking templates handle no resource safely
Status: ✅ Done
(Fatal Shopkeeper template issue fixed)

5. Coupon + partner auto-apply mechanics

Partner coupon auto-apply (role / URL / session)

Coupon casing normalized

Endpoint visibility & permissions hardened
Status: ✅ Done

6. Partner offline gateway cleanup

Offline gateway performs no calculations

Ledger is the single authority

Offline channel still creates valid orders & bookings
Status: ✅ Done

7. Partner portal reporting (safe replication)

Replace legacy inference logic

Use order ledger values

Align with Woo gross/net settings

Backward-compatible for older orders
Status: ✅ Done

8. Validation (moved into plugin)

Server-side price validation

mismatch → block

missing / zero → self-heal

Rental selection integrity check
Status: ✅ Done

9. Early Booking Discount (EB) engine

EB rules stored per event (recurrence-friendly)

EB applied before partner discount

Ledger fields persisted:

eb_details

base_after_eb

commission_basis
Status: ✅ Done

10. Hardening + snippet migration (legacy → plugin)
10.1 Parity checks across channels

Partner order ✅

Stripe:

Client (no coupon) ✅

Client (with coupon) ✅

Partner logged-in ✅
Status: ✅ Done

10.2 Migrate legacy snippets into plugin

#163 — SC Event header meta + renderer

Backward-compatible HTML & CSS variable contract

Remove duplicate “details in content”

Fix:

Date format when Event Details Block moved to header

Current test version: v0.2.65

11. Event admin UX consolidation

One clean meta panel:

Pricing + rentals

EB rules

Header controls + CSS variables

Partner toggles (if needed)

Clear schema & validation
Status: 🔜 Next (after 10.2 stabilizes)

12. Discount engine formalization

EB (done)

Partner rules

Coupon lifecycle

Multi-discount transparency (GF / cart / order / portal)
Status: 🔜 Later

13. Cleanup & finalization

Remove legacy snippets

Remove fallbacks / debug overlays

Lock public API

Tag stable release
Status: 🔜 Final stage

SECTION B — ISSUE & IDEAS BACKLOG (ACTIONABLE)

⚠️ Items are independent and non-sequential.
Each item becomes one GitHub issue / one chat thread.

Booking Flow Issues / Ideas

Issue format convention (recommended for GitHub):

ID

Title

Why

Done when

1. Email missing bike rental details (client-facing)

Why: Confusion → support tickets

Done when: Email prints rental/bike info from reliable meta (not get_resource())

2. Visually connect participation + rental (grouping)

Why: Admin & customer confusion

Pattern: tc_group_id, tc_scope, tc_hide_line, tc_event_key

Done when: Cart, checkout, order, emails show one grouped package

3. Deprecated API replacement

API: WC_Bookings_Controller::get_bookings_in_date_range

Done when: Replaced with WC_Booking_Data_Store::get_bookings_in_date_range

4. Resource can be false — defensive rendering

Why: Avoid fatals & wrong display

Done when: All templates handle “no resource” via meta

5. Booking group concept (data model)

Why: Woo sees separate bookings

Done when: Shared group ID stored on cart items, order items & bookings

6. Availability logic hardening

Why: Prevent overbooking

Done when: One centralized helper covers all edge cases

7. Scale-proof extras (delivery / insurance / shuttle)

Why: UI breaks with more services

Done when: Grouping supports multiple scoped services

8. Debug visibility control

Done when: Notices logged only, never echoed

9. Partner coupon auto-apply policy

Question: Can it be removed?

Done when: Policy chosen & enforced consistently

10. Partner Portal v2 (optional)

Filter by partner meta

CSV export

Woo-style tables
Done when: Portal is robust & exportable

11. Partner fast checkout (hidden billing fields)

Why: UX improvement

Done when: Safe, role-limited, attribution preserved

12. Admin mode in Partner panel

Why: Ops + reporting

Done when: Admin can view/filter all partners

13. Order summary price split (partner-aware)

Done when: Correct totals render per role from ledger

14. EB settings UX (no raw JSON)

Why: Reduce admin errors

Done when: UI-based tier editor with validation

15. GF entry cleanup to prevent ghost participants

Why: GravityView noise

Done when: Cart removal / expiry updates GF entry state

16. Show EB + partner discount visibly in event & form

Why: Trust + clarity

Done when: Form, cart, order show same discount logic

17. Clear EB rule messaging per event

Done when: “Book now save X% until DATE” visible

18. Visual differentiation of categories

Options: Colors / icons / logos

Done when: Category recognizable instantly

19. Notifications overhaul

Include: Actions, cancellation policy, event links

Done when: Consistent, professional, actionable

20. Field mapping layer in plugin settings

Why: Remove hardcoded GF field IDs

Done when: Mapping UI with validation exists

21. Consent field with Privacy Policy link

Done when: Dynamic, multilingual-safe link

22. qTranslate raw strings in admin

Done when: Admin output is clean

23. Image choice design for unavailable resources

Done when: CSS-class-based state system replaces inline CSS

24. Snippet audit candidate #136

Why: Possible OpenPOS dependency

Done when: Dependency verified and refactored safely

25. Technical recommendations bundle

25A Multi-day availability range bug

25B Hardcoded product_cat IDs

25C Timezone consistency

25D Partner detection performance

25E Pricing model transition (GF display only)
Done when: Each sub-item resolved safely

26. TCBF-026 — Logo sizing meta not applied

Status: ✅ DONE

Phase: 10.2

Scope: Event header

Done when: Logo size respects per-event meta + CSS contract

27. TCBF-027 — Header date/details styling regression

Status: ✅ DONE

Phase: 10.2

Done when: Layout matches intended design

28. TCBF-028 — Header date format bug

Status: ✅ DONE

Preferred: 4/02/2026 10:00–13:00

Scope: Event header date renderer

Done when: Dates render according to Sugar Calendar settings, compact for same-day events

29. GravityView participants index starts at 0

Done when: Index is 1-based

30. Core integrity upgrade (GF lifecycle)

State machine: draft → in_cart → paid → expired

Cart TTL alignment

Reverse hooks

Idempotency key

Status: ✅ DONE / 🔒 LOCKED

Note:
Gravity Forms frontend lifecycle hardening and decimal-comma price integrity protection are now complete and locked.
Stage-3 auto-repair ensures frontend prices remain correct even if GF re-renders or mis-parses values.

🧩 Notes / Edge Cases

Bike rental price 1,00 € incorrectly showing as 100

Must support 0 € rentals safely
